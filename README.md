# TiddlyChrome
A Google Chrome App that saves TW changes back to File System. 

##Todo
 - Use an alert box that goes away once the thankyou message is recieved notifying the user that it is not safe to use this app with a TiddlyWiki unless the saver is working.
 - Have the saver send all changes as a temp-save message the parent window, which sends it to the background page to be saved in case the window closes. If and when the window closes and there are significant unsaved changes, another window should popup saying that there were unsaved changes and show the user the list of tiddlers which had unsaved changes. It should also let them download the JSON as a file, which can be dragged back into the TiddlyWiki if they still want some of the information.
